Observations:
	1.	problem size: the problem size is either the size of the input or the value of the command-line argument 
	 	(↑ size, ↑running time)

Union-Find (dynamic connectivity)
-	union command: creates connections between 2 objects
-	find/connnected query: is there a path connecting the 2 objects?

We assume "is connected to" is an equivalence relation
-	Relexive: p is connected to p
-	Symmetric: if p is connected to q, then q is connected to p
-	Transitive: if p is connected to q ad q is connected to r, the p is connected to r

connected components: max set of objects that are mutally connected
